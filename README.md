# Risk-Analysis
Here is an overview of my risk analysis code done in R.
The chapter revolves around Modern Portfolio Theory (MDT), Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES).
It includes GARCH and Arima residuals calculations, to check for regressive autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity.

I also provide code for optimal portfolio weights according to 
- Global Minimum Variance (GMV)
- Most Diversified Portfolio (MDP)
- Minimum Tail Dependent Portfolio (MTD)
- Equal Risk Contributied Portfolio (ERC)
Portfolio theory.
